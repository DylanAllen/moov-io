      content : What Moov is doing is exactly what this industry needs – A team that knows the industry inside and out collaborating to re-build everything. With more and more banks making a shift towards FinTech, that don’t have the institutional knowledge to manage compliance and technology at scale, the kind of tools Moov is building are exactly what will push all of us forward. Of all the people and teams I’m excited about in FinTech Moov is at the top of my list.

They’re breaking down the traditional walls and creating an easier playing field for all.
