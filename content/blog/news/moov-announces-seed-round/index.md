Today, the news of our $5.5 million seed round became public! All of us at Moov have been looking forward to this day for a while, and we've internally referred to it as Moov-ing day. We're excited because we have the momentum and support of 7 institutional investors, led by Bain Capital, as well as 27 individual investors who believe in Moov's mission, who are generous with their time and their knowledge.

This round allows us to grow the Moov community and accelerate our product roadmap.
